# Java-Data-Structures-Benchmark

## Description

This repository serves as a comprehensive benchmark for various Java data structures and sorting algorithms. Whether youâ€™re interested in linked lists, arrays, or merge sort, this project provides insights into their efficiency and behavior. The program deals with a CSV data file (randomly generated from mockaroo).

## Features

1. **Data Import and Manipulation**:
   - Load data from CSV files into different data structures.
   - Explore the behavior of custom data structures (e.g., `MovieLinkList`, `MovieArray`).
2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Compare insertion sort and merge sort performance.
   - Observe how different properties (order, proportion) affect sorting efficiency.
3. **Search and Retrieval**:
   - Search for movie data using various keys (e.g., ID, name, year, director).
   - Evaluate both successful and unsuccessful searches.
4. **Execution Time Analysis**:
   - Each function displays its execution time, allowing you to assess which structure best suits your needs.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the provided Java classes and examples.
3. Run the benchmark tests to observe the behavior of different data structures and sorting algorithms.
